    <h1>CS349 Assignment 1</h1>
    <strong><em>Due: Jan 21 (Wednesday) 5PM EST</em></strong>

    <div>
        <h2>Assignment Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The goals of this assignment are to give you an opportunity to apply the concepts of:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                model, view, controller (MVC),
            </li>
            <li>
                events and event listeners,
            </li>
            <li>
                the interactor tree and DOM,
            </li>
            <li>
                use of the HTML5 canvas, and
            </li>
            <li>
                manipulation of the DOM.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You will do so in the context of creating an interactive, single-page web app.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

        <p>
            How is your mental and physical health affected by your activities? Good question!
        </p>

        <p>
            In this assignment, you will create a "quantified self" web application called
            <em>UTrack</em>, which allows users to track their daily activities and various health measures.
            They will also be able to analyze the data through summaries you create.
        </p>

        <p>
            Specifically, users will be able to choose from a list of activities, then indicate the time spent
            on the activity, and their energy, stress, and happiness levels while performing that activity:
            <img src="images/input.png" class="img-responsive">
            As you can see in the mock-up, users can also view the last time they entered a data point, and what
            that data point was.
        </p>

        <p>
            The energy, stress, and happiness levels should be numbers: You should validate that the data entered
            is a number before storing it. If it's not, you should alert the user in some fashion. The same
            goes for the duration of the event (which should be a number in minutes). This alert should be
            user-friendly and helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
            The way the user enters their energy, stress, and happiness levels can be modified, as long as their
            input resolves to a number. You should find an efficient, user-friendly way of supporting this
            activity, so users aren't discouraged to enter data.
        </p>


        <p>
            Users will be able to switch to a view that enables them to view summaries, graphs, and plots of their data:
            <img src="images/table.png" class="img-responsive">

            This analysis interface should, at a minimum, support the following views:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                A <em>table</em> showing a summary of the time spent in each activity,
            </li>
            <li>
                And at least one graph that summarizes the data collected so far. This may be a bar graph
                of total time spent per activity, scatterplots of health measures across activities, etc.
                Your graphs should have labels, be scaled properly, and be generally easy to use and to understand.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You will need to provide the necessary controls to allow the user to switch between these views and
            choose any relevant parameters for visualizing the data.
        </p>

        <p>
            As an example, here is a mock-up of what a graph may look like (note: you do not need to worry about
            having text rotated as shown in the image -- that will be for a future assignment):
            <img src="images/graph.png" class="img-responsive">
        </p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h2>
            Implementation Requirements
        </h2>

        <p>
            Your implementation must make use of the model-view-controller architecture. Specifically,
            you must implement the following models, stubbed out in <a href="js/model.js">model.js</a>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>ActivityStoreModel</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>GraphModel</code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>ActivityStoreModel</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>ActivityStoreModel</code> represents the data points collected by the user. It should
            implement a listener interface, as described in the supplied code. Briefly, other code should be
            able to register with the model to know when a new data point has been added or deleted (and what that data
            point was, and when it was added or deleted).
        </p>

        <h3>GraphModel</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>GraphModel</code> represents the currently chosen graph to render. It should also provide a
            listener interface, as described in the supplied code. In short, code should be able to register with that
            model
            to know when the chosen graph has changed, so the interface can update itself accordingly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            Testing
        </h2>

        <p>
            An essential part of software development is testing your code. Developing user interfaces is no different.
        </p>

        <p>
            For unit testing assignments, we will be using <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>,
            <a href="http://chaijs.com/">Chai</a>, and <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a>. All of the components
            necessary to do unit testing are included, along with some sample unit tests.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Run the Unit Tests</h3>

        <p>
            When loaded, the <a href="unit_tests.html">unit_tests.html</a> file will execute the unit tests found in
            <a href="js/unit_tests/provided_unit_tests.js">provided_unit_tests.js</a> and
            <a href="js/unit_tests/marking_unit_tests.js">marking_unit_tests.js</a>. There is a link at the bottom
            of the web app's page to go to this unit test. This link should remain within the code, so TAs can
            easily execute your unit tests.
        </p>

        <p>
            The provided_unit_tests.js file includes a number of unit tests to test basic aspects of your framework.
            <em>You must create at least 5 additional unit tests for this assignment.</em> Add these unit tests after
            the existing unit tests, and ensure they execute properly and without error! <strong>Note that the
            unit tests, as provided, will fail until you implement the code missing in <code>model.js</code>.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The marking_unit_tests.js file is empty: Do not add anything to this. It will be overwritten with our own
            unit tests at marking time, to further test your code.
        </p>

        <h3>What We Will Test for Marking</h3>

        <p>
            We will be testing your model-view-controller architecture, and the classes, in general,
            to ensure they conform to the specifications provided.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Implementation Details and Constraints</h3>

        <p>
            You must complete the assignment within the following constraints:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>You must use only HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and the included JavaScript and CSS files.
                <em>You may not use any other third-party JavaScript or CSS files for this assignment, including
                    web frameworks.</em> However, we have included both underscore.js and Bootstrap's CSS. If you've
                never used CSS before, Bootstrap can be a bit overwhelming to learn, at first. Thankfully,
                it provides useful defaults, and this web app is not overly complicated or demanding in terms of layout.
            </li>
            <li>
                When users do something like choose to switch between input and analysis,
                you should modify the DOM in place, rather than directing users to a separate page. In other words,
                <em>there should be only one web page that the user loads and interacts with -- they should never leave
                    it</em>
                (with the exception of the unit tests).
                <em>We will take off significant marks if you redirect the user to another page.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                The wireframe designs are meant to be a suggestion for how the interface and interaction could be
                supported. You have latitude to change how users provide input to the system, but it must be
                <em>at least</em> as usable as the design we provide. You will also need to improve the visual design
                beyond the sparse wireframe designs provided.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must use the HTML5 canvas object to render your graphs. Demo code and links to tutorials and
                references
                are included.
            </li>
            <li>
                All of your JavaScript files should work with (and include) <code>'use strict';</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must use the <code>addEventListener()</code> means of responding to events in the browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                You do not need to worry about storing data, though you may use window.localStorage in the browser,
                if you wish. We provide a function to randomly generate data that you can use
                to facilitate testing your graphs with.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may use either tables or CSS to render the time summaries.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may use <em>code snippets</em> from third-party sources, but not entire solutions. For example,
                your graphing code <em>must be your own</em>. You must cite the use of any third-party code (including
                a URL if the example was obtained online).
            </li>
            <li>
                Your assignment may not make use of any external files loaded over the Internet.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Marking</h2>

        <p>
            To receive a great mark, you must implement the system as described above, under the given constraints,
            with all unit tests passing, while having an aesthetically pleasing design and a great user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            Easy, right?
        </p>

        <p>
            As a <em>rough</em> guide, <em>about 25%</em> of your mark will be allocated to the visual design and user
            experience,
            with the rest allocated to implementation concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
            TAs will mark your assignment using the latest version of Chrome on whatever platform
            they use on a daily basis. In theory, the specific platform shouldn't matter. If we
            find platform differences, we'll handle them as they arise. They will mark the assignment
            in "offline" mode (i.e., with no access to the Internet).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>How to Submit</h2>
        You will use subversion to both check out and submit your assignment. Details can be found on the
        <a href="https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/courses/CS349/w15/about.html#svn">course website</a>.
